Educational Website To Teach Python

This was for my scholarship technolgy project, it was designed to be a free web based teaching platform for Python. The
UI and the tutorials might need a bit of work done but everything functions propperly

Setup
=====

To set this up just copy the files ( not including assets or sql folders ) into the web directory. Setup your database
and set the information in the includes file to the corect information to access the database, then import the sql files in the sql folder into your database, this will setup the database correctly.
